# PiHome
Code Repo for my Raspberry Pis I am using at home.

I currently have a Pi B+ in a little enclusre wired to a 20x4 lcd screen via i2c.
I would like to use this as a little display device; display notes (left via webserver?), calendar information etc.
Eventually I would love to expand the hardware to include further features.
One day I may even add a Mic and Speaker and start playing with Jasper on it - until the I shall have aplay around :)
